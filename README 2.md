## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structure and content layout.
- **CSS**: Styling, utilizing:
  - Flexbox for layout management.
  - CSS variables for consistent theming.
  - Media queries for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and dynamic content management.

### Backend
- **Django**: Web framework for backend development.
- **Python**: Programming language for server-side logic.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for data storage.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The app adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Dynamic Bookmarking**: Users can bookmark or un-bookmark movies and TV shows, with changes reflected instantly in the UI.
- **Real-time Search Functionality**: The search updates with every keystroke, providing instant feedback on the number of results found.
- **Conditional Data Rendering**: HTML content is dynamically generated based on the userâ€™s interactions and database values.

## Concepts and Theories Employed

- **Functional Programming**: The JavaScript codebase emphasizes pure functions and immutability, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Modularization**: The JavaScript logic is organized into modules, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.
- **Responsive Design Principles**: Utilizing Flexbox and media queries to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices.

## Lessons Learned

- **Importance of Responsiveness**: Building a responsive design from the ground up helped me understand the nuances of user experience across devices.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Managing dynamic updates with JavaScript improved my skills in working with asynchronous data and user interaction.
- **Modular Code Benefits**: Organizing code into modules enhanced both maintainability and readability, allowing for easier debugging and feature expansion.
- **User-Centric Development**: Incorporating user feedback mechanisms, like real-time search results, taught me the value of iterative development based on user needs.
